## Licensing  
Public Domain. If my licensing is wrong, please let me know. Use at your own risk for whatever you want. Feel free to change the namespaces as well. Apparently licensing is hard and complicated. If your country doesn't have a public domain, feel free to say you found this on the side of the road.
